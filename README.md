# Poker Money Simulator

Poker Money Simulator is a python project that simulates a poker game using virtual money. The project aims to provide players with the ability to play poker without the need to use real money. This project is not intended to fully implement a poker game as it does not simulate the actual cards held, rather it creates an interface that facilitates the rounds using a virtual money system.

## Project Overview

The project includes features for managing players, handling the pot and simulating the overall game flow.
The initial version will be terminal based but the end goal is to create a GUI based version.
